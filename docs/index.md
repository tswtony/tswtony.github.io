# Welcome to the trailside!
I like hiking and the oudoors. In my spare time, I like to share my thoughts on stuff while wandering through the woods.
## Why the trailside?
I go into more detail on my [Why go outdoors?](why) page, but the short version is that I truly believe that green space is a necessary component of a healthy mind and body. Being outside on the trail (and off it) gives me euphoria like nothing else.
