## Review
The Ashintully Gardens is more of a historical property than a nature hike, so my usual review format is somewhat misleading. I was told by a co-worker that the Gardens were some of the most beautiful in the area&msash;that's a lot to live up to, considering we were having this conversation at [Naumkeag](https://thetrustees.org/place/naumkeag/) (one of The  Trustees' flagship properties).

The trails themselves are significantly less well-defined than at other properties; I get the feeling the intent is to simply wander the grounds (perhaps with a picnic basket). However, the day I went was particularly strong with bugs, so I didn't feel like a casual stroll would suffice. I ended up taking a short circuit along the Gardens and Upper Lawn before proceeding to the Marble Palace, atop the hill. As far as the hike went, it was about average. Signage was adequate, but it was clear the path was very seldom tread.

The property seemed nearly unmaintained when I visited. I'm not sure if I perhaps went too early in the season to really experience it properly, but I feel that a property open to the public at all times should perhaps be at least presentable. I didn't get that impression from my walk-through. Not only that, but it wasn't until I'd already been to (and explored, perhaps irresponsibly) the ruins of the Marble Palance that I found a sign warning me not to stand on or in the ruins.

As there is a private house situated directly in front of the main parking area, I chose to park at a secondary lot up the road. The placement seemed a little odd to me, but the ownership of private property is a world my generation probably won't experience anyway so what do I know?
## Final thoughts
The Ashintully Gardens appear to be relatively unmaintained. It's an interesting quick walk around, but the state of the gardens leaves me feeling disappointed. The ruins of the Marble Palace are interesting from a historical perspective, but I wish there had been someone staffing the location to provide some historical interpretation. All in all, it's a decent hike up the hill but other properties offer much of the same in a much nicer package.
