## Review
Monument Mountain is possibly one of the most beautiful and scenic properties I've had the pleasure to visit. While this wasn't my first visit to MM, I enjoy my hikes there every time I go. The hike itself is fairly short, all things considered (only about 2.5 miles or so), but the elevation gain is significant&mdash;nearly 700 feet of altitude gain by the midpoint of the hike. The trails are maintained very well and are clear for the most part. There is a $6 fee per vehicle to park in the main parking lot, but no entrance fee.

The uphill portion of the hike (along the northbound Hickey Trail) is excellent, starting off by immediately departing from the parking lot adjacent to US-7 and heading away from the road into thickly-wooded mountainside. This has the benefit of both blocking off road sounds and heading right into a cooler area. The hike takes one alongside several natural landmarks, such as enormous pieces of quartz, an unnamed waterfall, and a spring-fed stream. The Hickey trail meets the Mohican Monument and Peeskawso Peak trails simultaneously and ends.

The Peeskawso Peak trail leads up toward the highest elevation point, which has an incredible total view of the surrounding region with its rolling hills. From there, it heads down around Peeskawso Peak itself (which does not have a trail leading to it, as it is considered sacred) before reaching a junction where the Peeskawso Peak trail continues downward, with an optional spur heading to the Devil's Puplit overlook. The overlook, in my opinion, has the best view you can get on this mountain, where sheer cliffs are visible with the eponymous freestanding Devil's Pulpit in clear view. At the time of filming, there were five peregrine falcons nesting just off the overlook (one adult female and four juveniles), though they were not around when I was filming.

The downward arm of the Peeskawso Peak trail leads along the backside of the mountain, which tends to be cooler since it's exposed to less sunlight. It's a good, refreshing climb down. Upon meeting the Mohican Monument trail, the elevation levels out a bit and it's a gentle walk back to the parking lot. The Mohican Monument trail does unfortunately follow adjacent to US-7 for about half a mile, which is a loud and distracting end to the hike.

The hike is moderate to difficult intensity, and many parts of the trail are not accessible to people with mobility impairments. The difficulty is often underestimated.

Monument Mountain has an extensive history in both indigenous and American culture, being a sacred site for the Mohican people (Stockbridge-Munsee, specifically) as well as a popular desination for classic writers such as Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne.
## Final thoughts
I cannot recommend Monument Mountain highly enough. Beginner and experienced hikers alike will find this to be a challenging hike, but well worth it. The views alone are incredible, but when combined with the rewarding hike it's a great, if short, hike in the Berkshires.
