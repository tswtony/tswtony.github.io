## Review
Where do I even begin with Norris Reservation? This was the first [Trustees](https://thetrustees.org/) property I visited in a very long time, and the quality of the trails blew me away. Despite being late in the season, I never had any difficulty distinguishing between on- and off-trail.

A quiet weekday walk, Norris was very easy to get to. Parking was pretty limited (about 8 designated spots), but while I was there I had no issues. The historical information about the park as I made my way into the woods was a nice educational moment. The park had several available trail loops with varying sights to see.

For a short walk, the Gordon Pond trail was beautiful and in view of the water the entire length. The trail ran right along the edge of the property for a short while, which did take away from its "naturalness", but I imagine there isn't much the Trustees can do about that. Longer trails, like the River Loop and McMullan trail, offer a light, easy hiking experience. I never had any difficulty and never felt like I was at risk of injuring myself.

The scenic views along the North River were near-idyllic, and the preserved boathouse (with original wood and trusses, as I later found out) is a great place to stop and rest. The views were somewhat marred by the presence of other properties' docks and boats moored there, but as before that isn't something the Trustees would have control over.
## Final thoughts
Overall, Norris Reservation felt like an amazing beginner trail with lots of options for the day hiker.
